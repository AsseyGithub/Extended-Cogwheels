# Extended Cogwheels (Multiloader)

[Forge & Fabric, 1.18.2 & 1.19.2] Adding more cogwheels to the createmod aswell as providing progression systems to modpack developers through configurations

### KubeJS Integration

As of version 2.1 and above extended cogwheels has allows for you to create your own custom cogwheels easily with KubeJS (when both mods are present)

Cogwheels can now be created like any other block just specify the type and properties give it a texture and try it out in game

Example Adding A Small Cogwheel (Relevant texture files are placed in `/assets/kubjs/textures/block/example_cogwheel.png`)
```javascript
// startup_scripts/demo.js
onEvent('block.registry', event => {
	event.create('example_cogwheel', 'cogwheel')
	    .material('wood')
	    .displayName('Example Cogwheel');
})
```
Example Adding A Large Cogwheel
```javascript
// startup_scripts/demo.js
onEvent('block.registry', event => {
    event.create('large_example_cogwheel', 'large_cogwheel')
        .material('wood')
        .displayName('Example Cogwheel');
})
```

All Valid Variations Are `cogwheel`, `large_cogwheel`, `half_shaft_cogwheel`, `large_half_shaft_cogwheel`, `shaftless_cogwheel`, `large_shaftless_cogwheel` 

Existing builder methods for blocks are all supported for cogwheels. You can find some documentation for that here - https://wiki.latvian.dev/books/kubejs-legacy/page/custom-blocks
